# Challenge
# Min-maxing
# Define a function named largest_difference that takes a list of numbers as its only parameter.

# Your function should compute and return the difference between the largest and smallest number in the list.

# For example, the call largest_difference([1, 2, 3]) should return 2 because 3 - 1 is 2.

# You may assume that no numbers are smaller or larger than -100 and 100.
def largest_difference(arr):
    mini = min(arr)
    maxi = max(arr)
    return maxi - mini
# short solution


def largest_difference(numbers):
    return max(numbers) - min(numbers)

# naive solution


def largest_difference(numbers):
    smallest = 100
    for n in numbers:
        if n < smallest:
            smallest = n

    largest = -100
    for n in numbers:
        if n > largest:
            largest = n

    difference = largest - smallest
    return difference
